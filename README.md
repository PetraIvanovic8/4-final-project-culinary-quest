## Product Vision Statement
Culinary Quest provides a more organized way to keep track of ingredients and recipes, allowing users to always know what they can make with what is on hand.

## Technologies Utilized

**Version Control**: Git for local version control and GitHub for remote repository hosting.

**Frontend**:
- **React.js**: Utilized for building the user interface with a component-based architecture.
- **CSS**: Applied for styling the components and enhancing the user experience.

**Backend**:
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: The web application framework used to build the backend API.
- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database used for storing application data (user data, ingredient data, and recipe data).

**Deployment**:
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Used to deploy and host the full-stack application, ensuring it's accessible online.

**Artificial Intelligence**:
- **DALL-E**: An AI program by OpenAI used to generate images from textual descriptions, employed to create unique and uniform images for the application.

## Build & Run Instructions
The steps to build and run the webapp are as follows:

1. Using your built-in terminal, navigate to the repo folder.
2. Navigate into the `back-end` folder.
3. Start the backend by running `npx nodemon server`; it should now be running on `localhost:3001`. If an error occurs, try running `npm install` to ensure all dependency packages are installed.
4. After confirming the backend is running, navigate into the `front-end` folder.
5. Start the frontend by running `npm start`; it should now be running on `localhost:3000`. If an error occurs, try running `npm install` first to ensure all dependencies are present.
6. The application should now be accessible in your browser.

### Error and Bug Reporting
Most issues that arise tend to occur when running the commands to build the frontend and backends, typically due to missing dependencies. Resolve this by running `npm install`. If issues persist, manually install missing dependencies via `npm install <missing_dep_name>`.

For unresolved issues, please create a GitHub issue with the `bug` tag.
